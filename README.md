My attempt to create a Primary Domain Controller with a Raspberry Pi 4

While I've really loved playing with the EspressoBin while trying to create a Domain Controller, ACLs have been my Achilles heel.  I'm hoping that the Pi 4 kernel supports ACLs, which would make my life easier.  I'm pleased as punch to use my development EspressoBin as a sweet little NAS, so I'm not *completely* heartbroken.  Too Bad Marvell hasn't dedicated more energy to supporting the EspressoBin.  She had some real potential.

NOTE:  The attached scripts will fail!  This project is just starting.
